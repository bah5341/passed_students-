# Hamilton Final Project: Passing Students

## Overview

A python program that takes a CSV file directly downloaded from Qualtrics and distinguishes passing students (80% or higher) from failing students (lower than 80%). I designed this project specifically for the Qualtrics post tests I utilize in my work, in order to gain an understanding of students who are passing the courses. For the breadth of this project, I only utilized one post test, however this code can be adapted to other CSV's downloaded from Qualtrics and seperated in this manner. 

## Installation and Usage 

For this code, you will need to download Python version 3. Additionally, you will need your CSV file. I used a CSV file from Qualtrics, but you can use whatever CSV file you'd like.
